1. What is this purpose of this Git repository? 

The repository is in a place to submit my assignments, reference as an initial portfolio, and reflect on progress over the semester.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was Assignment 2 because I enjoyed the visualization of creating a map, work with APIs, and gain a very preliminary understanding of how ride sharing apps are created. 

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

The only computer science class I had taken before this class was Comp 11 and that was 2.5 years ago. While I still often am slow with correcting syntax, I feel much more confident using developer tools and understand high level web dev. 

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

I do feel more comfortable with which resources to use and how many options there are to gain understanding and syntax aid for different web dev assignments I may work on in the future. Said this above, but I am very happy I learned how to use developer tools. Additionally, I believe having a better understanding of how the basic intuition behind how websites and apps are made is very valuable (especially through Assignment 1 and 2).

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

Working with APIs
